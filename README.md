## Fields
ID = unique ID number <br/>
ProperName = colloquial/english name <br/>
lum = brightness of a star in comparison to the sun (at the point of the star) <br/>
spect = spectral type of the star <br/>
ci = BV colour index of the star <br/>
comp = Index of the star in the system (1, 2, 3 for a three star system) <br/>
comp_primary = if not empty, indicates a multiple star. this, refers to unique ID of the primary star <br/><br/>
X = x position of the star (sun at x=0) <br/>
Y = y position of the star (sun at y=0) <br/>
Z = z position of the star (sun at z=0) <br/><br/>
AbsMag =  the magnitude of a stars brighness from a distance of 10 parsecs <br/>
StarSpectralTypeLetter = the spectral class of a star, this is dependent on temperature <br/>
StarSpectralTypeNumber = the brighness of the star within its spectral letter category <br/>
StarHRType = the stars type/stage in its lifestly (V =  main sequence, I = supergiant, III = subgiant, etc) <br/>
Mass = an approximation of a stars mass <br/>
Temperature = surface temperature of a star (kelvin) <br/>
Radius = an approximation of the physical radius of the star <br/><br/>
R = red RGB colour value <br/>
G = green RGB colour value <br/>
B = blue RGB colour value <br/>


XYZ are the Cartesian coordinates of the star,
in a system based on the equatorial coordinates as seen from Earth. <br/>
+X is in the direction of the vernal equinox (at epoch 2000), <br/>
+Z towards the north celestial pole, <br/>
+Y in the direction of R.A. 6 hours, declination 0 degrees
